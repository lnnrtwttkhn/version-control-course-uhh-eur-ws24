During this course, we want to ensure a safe, productive, and welcoming environment for everyone who attends.
All participants and speakers are expected to abide by this code of conduct.
We do not tolerate any form of discrimination or harassment in any form or by any means.
If you experience harassment or hear of any incidents of unacceptable behavior, please reach out to the course instructor, Lennart Wittkuhn ([{{< var team.lennart.email >}}]({{< var team.lennart.mailto >}})), so that we can take the appropriate action.

Unacceptable behavior is defined as:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form, verbal abuse of any attendee, speaker, or other person.
Examples include, but are not limited to, verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, national origin, inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces or in presentations, or threatening or stalking.
- Disruption of presentations throughout the course. We ask all participants to comply to the instructions of the speaker with regard to dedicated discussion space and time.
- Participants should not take pictures of any activity in the course room without asking all involved participants for consent and receiving this consent.

A first violation of this code of conduct will result in a warning, and subsequent violations by the same person can result in the immediate removal from the course without further warning.
The organizers also reserve the right to prohibit attendance of excluded participants from similar future workshops, courses or meetings they organize.
