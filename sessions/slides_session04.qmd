## {{< fa circle-question >}} When do I have to "Take the quiz"?

- Many chapters contain a "Take the quiz!" button
- These are the same quizzes that we assign to your as part of the sessions' learning objectives.
- **Take the quiz when you feel ready**, i.e., when you believe that **you reached the learning objectives**.
- Alternative: We'll let you know during the course when we think it's a good time to take the quiz.
- Remember: The quizzes are part of your **mandatory** course work!

## {{< fa circle-question >}} Will we also learn about Python or R?

- No, not directly, but you are free to use Git to track Python or R files that you use for other projects
- We will have a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) workshop in a later session:

:::

::: fragment
#### {{< fa circle-question >}} *"How do I find the `Users` folder on Windows?"*
- Use `~`
- If `pwd` is at `/:` you can still use `cd C:`
:::

::: fragment
#### {{< fa circle-question >}} *"What should my `{{< var course.project >}}` folder look like?"*
At least, a folder with `{{< var course.project >}}.txt` inside with at least one commit.
:::

## Even more questions from last session

::: fragment
#### {{< fa circle-question >}} *"How can I check if my folder is a Git repository?"*
- Use `ls -a` (to also show hidden files) and look for the `.git` folder
:::

::: fragment
#### {{< fa circle-question >}} *"The command line does not give feedback!"*
- Yes, I'm sorry ...
- Example: After `mkdir city-guide`, use `ls` to check if the `/city-guide` folder was created.
:::

::: fragment
#### {{< fa circle-question >}} *"Why can't I see my repository on my GitHub account?"*
- You need to explicitly connect the repository on your computer to GitHub.
- We will cover this topic in the sessions about GitHub (see schedule).
:::

## Important notes

::: fragment
#### {{< fa circle-exclamation >}} Make sure that there is no Git repository in your home directory!
- Your home directory is at `/Users/yourname` (macOS) or `C:\Users\yourname` (Windows).
- There should be no `.git` folder in your home directory (check with `ls -a`; see previous slide).
- If you find a `.git` folder in your home directory, **don't do anything and talk to us first!**
- We want to make sure that you don't accidentally track files in Git that you don't want to track.
:::

::: fragment
#### {{< fa circle-exclamation >}} After you open a fresh terminal, you always need to navigate to your repository first!
- Yes, I'm sorry ...
- Use `pwd` to check your current location and `cd` to move to another directory.
:::

::: fragment
#### {{< fa circle-exclamation >}} Use a Git `user.name` and `user.email` that you are comfortable with
- We will eventually practice to share Git repositories publicly on GitHub.
- Your `user.name` and `user.email` will be part of your commit history.
- A public repository will therefore reveal your `user.name` and `user.email`.

## Tip if you feel lost: Solutions

- All course exercises are documented in a dedicated chapter: [https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/misc/exercises.html](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/misc/exercises.html), including **solutions**!
- Exercise solutions can also be found **at the end of the slides**

::: fragment
### Caveats

- The solutions are just *one way* to implement the exercises.
- As always: Copy-pasting solutions might not help your understanding.
