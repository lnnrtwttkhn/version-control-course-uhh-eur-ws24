1. Commit at least three changes in `{{< var course.project >}}.txt`.
1. Make at least one commit using `git commit --amend`.
    - For example, add a a new entry without a title first, commit, then add a title and use `git commit --amend` to add the title change to the same commit.
1. Create a `.gitignore` file.
    - Everyone: Create a random file that you want to ignore, for example `image.jpg`.
    - All macOS users: Let your repository ignore `.DS_Store`.
