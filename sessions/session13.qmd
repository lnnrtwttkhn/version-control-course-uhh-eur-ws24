## Abstract

#### DataLad - Decentralized Management of Digital Objects for Open Science

With a general awareness of a reproducibility crisis in many scientific areas and increasing importance of research data management in science and policy making, data-driven fields require convenient and scalable data management solutions.
Standing on the shoulders of [Git](https://git-scm.com) and git-annex ([git-annex.branchable.com](https://git-annex.branchable.com), Joey Hess), [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org) provides a decentralized solution that enables the joint management of code, data, and complete containerized computational environments in a scalable and distributed fashion.
With features such as unambiguous version control, a wide spectrum of data transport mechanisms, convenient provenance capture, and re-execution for verification or as an alternative to storage and transport, it enables and facilitates many aspects of open and reproducible science: collaboration, sharing, analytical transparency, computational reproducibility of digital research objects, and disk-space aware storage and computing workflows on infrastructure that ranges from personal laptops up to supercomputers.
