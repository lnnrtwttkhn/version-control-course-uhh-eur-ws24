# Tags & Releases: Examples

## Example 1: MATLAB code for an experimental task in research

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4305888.svg){height="100%"}](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/310215989)

{{< fa display >}} <https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/highspeed-task>

{{< fa display >}} See [Code Availability Statement](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21970-2#code-availability) of paper:

> All code to run the behavioral task can be found at (<https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/highspeed-task>; <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4305888>)

### Advantages

1. **Reusability:** Code is on GitHub and can be forked, reviewed, reused, extended, etc.
1. **Reproducibility:** The *specific* version that was used in the original study is tagged.
1. **Modularity:** Other researchers can independently reuse only the code for the experimental task.
1. **Backup:** Code can be accessedd in *at least* two locations.
1. **Independence:** If GitHub disappears, a copy of the code is still on Zenodo.
1. **Recognition:** Other researchers can cite the code + views and downloads metrics on Zenodo.

# Course requirements

## From session 1: Your role

::: {.fragment}
#### **Active participation**
- This is a pass / fail course.
You pass if you fulfill all course requirements:
- Requirement 1: Come to at least **12 out of 14 sessions** (85%)
- Requirement 2: Complete all **surveys/quizzes**
- Requirement 3: Complete **all mandatory exercises** (implemented in Git)
:::

::: {.fragment}
#### How do we verify the course requirements?

1. Requirement 1: **Sign the attendance list**
1. Requirement 2: **Provide a personal codeword**.
At the end of the semester, send an email with your personal codeword to [{{< var project.email-secretary >}}]({{< var project.mailto-secretary >}}) (Christine Manor).
We will send our secretary a list of personal codewords and she will return a list of names.
1. Requirement 3: We check your GitHub repositories.

## Your tasks

**In order to pass this course**, you should have accomplished the following tasks:

::: {.incremental}

1. You have a public `{{< var course.project >}}` repository on GitHub (Sessions 03, 08, 12).
1. You added a text file (e.g., `.qmd` or `.txt`) with at least one city recommendation to the repository (Session 03).
1. You added a `.gitignore` file (ignoring a random file like an image) to the repository (Sessions 04, 05).
1. You created and merged a branch in your repository (Session 06). 
1. You created a pull request in a partner's repository, e.g., by adding a new recommendation (Sessions 09, 10).
1. You reviewed and merged the pull request of a partner in your `{{< var course.project >}}` repository (Sessions 09, 10).
1. You created an issue in Lennart's `{{< var course.project >}}` repository, a pull request from a fork fixing the issue, you implemented all additional requests and your pull request was approved and merged by Lennart (Session 11).

1. You completed all quizzes (see next slide).
1. You completed the extra assignment (if necessary, see next slide).

### How to verify participation

1. At the end of the semester, send an email with your personal codeword to [{{< var project.email-secretary >}}]({{< var project.mailto-secretary >}}) (Christine Manor), **not to us!**
1. Our secretary sends us an unsorted list with codewords.
1. We verify the quiz participation for each codeword and send Christine a list with codewords that completed all quizzes.
1. Christine compares the codewords with your names and send us an unsorted list with names.
