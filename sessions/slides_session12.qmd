# Tags & Releases: Examples

## Example 1: MATLAB code for an experimental task in research

### Advantages

1. **Reusability:** Code is on GitHub and can be forked, reviewed, reused, extended, etc.
1. **Reproducibility:** The *specific* version that was used in the original study is tagged.
1. **Modularity:** Other researchers can independently reuse only the code for the experimental task.
1. **Backup:** Code can be accessedd in *at least* two locations.
1. **Independence:** If GitHub disappears, a copy of the code is still on Zenodo.
1. **Recognition:** Other researchers can cite the code + views and downloads metrics on Zenodo.
