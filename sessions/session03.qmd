## Email

Dear course participants,

You are receiving this email because you are enrolled in the course "{{< var course.title >}}", which is taking place this summer semester at the University of Hamburg.
This is one of the few occasions when we will ask you to complete additional tasks outside of class time.

First, we hope that your initial explorations of the command line were intriguing and insightful.
Regarding this session's contents, we kindly ask you to complete the following tasks:

1. Finish reviewing the chapter about the command line and explore the various commands
1. Complete the exercises/quiz questions in this online survey: <https://version-control-cli.formr.org/>

We are very much looking forward to our next session on Monday when we will take our first steps in using Git!
For this session, it is important that you verify whether Git is installed on your computer.
To do this, we kindly ask you to complete the following tasks before our next meeting:

1. If you haven't yet completed the installation, please install Git.
The Version Control Book provides a chapter about "Installation" which should help you with the installation process: <https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/chapters/installation.html>
Send us an email if you encounter any problems during the installation process.
1. Everyone: Please complete our (short) survey regarding the installation process: <https://version-control-installation.formr.org>

Please ensure that you complete the surveys before our next session, ideally by Sunday evening at the latest.
This will give us enough time to review your responses before our session on Monday.

Further information about the course can be found on our course website: <https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-course-uhh-ss24/>

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please feel free to contact us directly via email.

We are looking forward to seeing you for the next session on Monday!

Best wishes,

Lennart Wittkuhn (Instructor) & Konrad Pagenstedt (Teaching Assistant)
