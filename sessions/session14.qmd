Dear course participants,

Thank you for your participation in the course "Track, organize and share your work: An introduction to Git for psychological research".
It was a pleasure for us teaching this course and we hope that you learned something useful.
Following up on our last session yesterday, we have a few important announcements and tasks for you to complete:

First, please make sure to **complete the course evaluation** using the following link: 

<https://evasys-online.uni-hamburg.de/evasys/online.php?pswd=NWSWC>

Your feedback is very valuable to us and will help us to improve the course even further.
Also, course evaluations are relevant for Lennart's academic career, so you would do him a great favor.
Thank you!

Second, please remember to **complete all tasks relevant for passing the course**, mainly completing the quizzes and all `recipes` repository tasks:

**Regarding the quizzes:** Almost everyone has completed all the necessary quizzes.
Attached to this email is a list of missing quizzes associated with each personal codeword.
Note, that **only the quizzes in bold text need to be completed** to pass. 
If anything seems incorrect, please let us know immediately.
Additionally, please remember to send our secretary (Christine Manor) an email with your personal codeword at [sekretariat-luv.psych@uni-hamburg.de](mailto:sekretariat-luv.psych@uni-hamburg.de).

**Regarding the exercises:** Most of you have also completed all implementation tasks in your own repository.
Here is the list of required tasks again with instructions on how you can check if you have completed them or not:

1. You have a public `recipes` repository on GitHub.
1. You added a text file (e.g., `.qmd` *or* `.txt`) with at least one recipe to the repository.
1. You created a pull request in a partner's repository (e.g., adding a new recipe).
1. You merged the pull request of a partner in your `recipes` repository.
1. You created a pull request in Lennart's `recipes` repository, you implemented all additional requests and your pull request was merged by Lennart.
1. You implemented the changes suggested by Konrad in your `recipes` repository and closed the issue.
1. You created a release of your `recipes` repository on GitHub.

We will review your repositories in a week, and you will receive an email then if you have not already completed everything.
Importantly, as mentioned during the seminar: Please don't worry too much about the pass/fail requirements.
We will make sure that everyone has had enough time and help to complete all these tasks.

Third, **for everyone who missed more than two sessions:** You will receive a separate email with an additional task shortly that we ask you to complete to make up for any additional missed sessions.
Completing this assignment is an extra task for you in order to pass the course requirements.
We will continuously mark everyone as passed on Stine who completed all tasks.

Finally, we really hope that you found the course useful and that you will have future opportunities to apply your new skills in a project.
Using Git in a "real-world project" will bring new challenges but we promise that it will be immensely beneficial in the long run and an invaluable chance to further practice your Git skills.
The Version Control Book and course website will stay online for the foreseeable future and we will continue developing these materials so you can always go back to these materials for later reference.
Also, and we really mean this, always feel free to reach out to us if you have any further questions or problems using Git.

Thank you again for your participation in the course and enjoy the summer!

Best wishes,

Lennart Wittkuhn (Instructor) & Konrad Pagenstedt (Teaching Assistant)

## Email 2

Dear ... and ... ,

We noticed that you have missed more than two sessions of our course "Track, organize and share your work: An introduction to Git for psychological research".

To meet the course requirements, we kindly ask you to complete an additional exercise:

Please work together to each **add a recipe to your partner's repository following GitHub Flow**.
Detailed instructions can be found in the slides for [session 9 ](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-course-uhh-ss24/sessions/slides_session09.html#/implementation-exercises
) (Task 1) and [session 10](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-course-uhh-ss24/sessions/slides_session10.html#/implementation-exercises
).
We leave it up to you whether you add each other as collaborators to your repositories or use a fork.
Please don't forget to open an issue in your partner's repository first and, ideally, close the issue by referencing it in your pull request or commit.
The assignment is completed once your PR is merged.

Please complete this extra assignment together with the other requirements by the end of July.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to contact us directly via email.

Best wishes,

Lennart Wittkuhn (Instructor) & Konrad Pagenstedt (Teaching Assistant)
