## I need help!

::: fragment
### Help yourself

- Look at the solutions on the [exercises page](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/misc/exercises.html) in the Version Control Book (or on each session's slides)
- Start fresh with a "prepared" repository: Download from the [exercises page](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/misc/exercises.html) in the Version Control Book

::: fragment
### We help you

- Let us know! Ask questions!
- Send an email with questions!
- Ask for an office hour!
:::

::: fragment
### Fellow students help you

- This is a **team exercise**: We want everyone to keep up!
- Don't be shy and ask for help from your session partner.
- If you notice that your session partner needs help, please help them first
(you will also deepen your knowledge by helping others).

## Questions from last session

::: fragment
#### {{< fa circle-question >}} *"How do we submit the exercises?"*

- During later sessions, you will learn how to share your `{{< var course.project >}}` repository with us via GitHub.
- How you implemented the exercises should be registered as Git commits in your repository.
- Therefore, we can - retrospectively - check if and how you implemented the exercises (yay, *version* control!).
:::

::: fragment
#### {{< fa circle-question >}} *"How can I make changes in a text (`.txt`) file?"*
- Remember: **It's just a regular text file on your computer.**
- Option 1: Use a regular text editor (e.g., TextEdit on macOS, Notepad++ on Windows).
- Option 2: Use `vim` directly from the command line (see chapter / session on "Setup").
- Option 3: Use command line commands like `echo "My text" >> city-guide.txt`.

#### {{< fa circle-question >}} *"I ran `git commit` but nothing happened?"*
- Maybe you forgot to run `git add` before?

## Recap: Best practices for commit messages

::: fragment
![](../images/xkcd-git-commit.png)
:::

::: fragment
- Try to keep commit messages **short** (less than 72 characters)
- Use **present tense** and start with an **imperative** verb to indicate the purpose of the commit, for example "add", "fix", "improve" (as if you are giving orders to the codebase to change its behavior)

> If applied, this commit will ... [*your commit message*]

- Try to describe **why** a change is being made
- Link specific [issues](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/chapters/issues.html) that are addressed by your commit
- Use the **description** for more explanation and context

::: {.notes}
**Illustration of branches in a Git repository.** Each circle represents a commit. Commits on the `Main` branch are shown in gray. The branch `Feature A` (blue circles) was created from the `Main` branch and later merged again. In-between, another branch `Feature A-1` was created from the `Feature A` branch (green circles) and merged with that branch again before the `Feature A` branch was eventually merged with the `Main` branch. The branch `Feature B` was created but abandoned and not merged with the `Main` branch.
