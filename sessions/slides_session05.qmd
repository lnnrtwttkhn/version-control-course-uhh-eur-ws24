# Survey results

## Recap: Best practices for commit messages

::: fragment
![](../images/xkcd-git-commit.png)
:::

::: fragment
- Try to keep commit messages **short** (less than 72 characters)
- Use **present tense** and start with an **imperative** verb to indicate the purpose of the commit, for example "add", "fix", "improve" (as if you are giving orders to the codebase to change its behavior)

> If applied, this commit will ... [*your commit message*]

- Try to describe **why** a change is being made
- Link specific [issues](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/chapters/issues.html) that are addressed by your commit
- Use the **description** for more explanation and context

## Today's topic: Branches

![Image from [Chapter "Git Branches"](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/vcs/vcs-git-branches.html) of the ["The Turing Way handbook to reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science"](https://book.the-turing-way.org/), used under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/LICENSE.md).](../images/turing-way-branches.png){#fig-branches}

::: {.notes}
**Illustration of branches in a Git repository.** Each circle represents a commit. Commits on the `Main` branch are shown in gray. The branch `Feature A` (blue circles) was created from the `Main` branch and later merged again. In-between, another branch `Feature A-1` was created from the `Feature A` branch (green circles) and merged with that branch again before the `Feature A` branch was eventually merged with the `Main` branch. The branch `Feature B` was created but abandoned and not merged with the `Main` branch.

## Implementation Exercises

::: fragment

### 1. Create and merge a branch

1. Create a new branch called `feature`.
1. Switch to your new branch.
1. Add a new recipe to your recipes text file.
1. Switch back to the default branch (`main` or `master`).
1. Merge the `feature` branch with your default branch and delete the `feature` branch afterwards.
:::

::: fragment

### 2. Create and resolve a  merge conflict

Deliberately create a merge conflict by editing the same section of a file on two separate branches and attempting to merge them.
An example can be found in the Version Control Book chapter.
Resolve the merge conflict and delete the feature branch afterwards.
