- we heard a lot about artificial intelligence
- what does "intelligence" even mean?
- as psychologists & cognitive neuroscientists we are interested in understanding human "natural" or biological intelligence
- our group is interested in the convergence between neuroscience and artificial intelligence research ("Neuro AI")
- e.g., "why are humans so fast in learning a wide range of tasks in complex environments"
- we use cognitive and psychological approaches, neural measurement using fMRI and EEG and integrate and compare them with computational approaches from reinforcement learning and artificial neural networks

## Code of Conduct

{{< include ../_code-of-conduct.qmd >}}

# Survey results

## Expectations

- No idea (for example: "i really have no idea about that")

- Data analysis (for example: "How to work with research data")

- **Git/GitHub** (for example: "Practical tasks with git and github, theoretical background")

## Hopes

- Data analysis skills (for example: "Learning practical information about data analyses")

- Coding skills (for example: "Hopes for better coding skills post-course")

- Science Communication (for example: "Science communication and networking using research") 

- Version Control Skills (for example: "Getting an idea of what is possible with GitHub")

## Worries

- Lack of coding skills (for example: "My low ability in coding")

- Inadequate previous knowledge (for example: "I worry that I don't have enough previous knowledge")

- Language barrier 

- Learning pace

## Motivation

- Pragmatic course selection (for example:  "I needed a course for 'Wahlbereich' and this one was the only available one.")

- Learning new skills (for example: "For me it is very important to get to know tools and learn how to handle them.")

## Version Control

### Can you briefly define the term version control?

- No idea (for example: "I donâ€™t know what that is")

- "(...) it's about comparing the latest version of someone else who is working on the same project as me with my version"

## Scenarios

#### Imagine a scenario where you crafted a brilliant paragraph for your document (for example, your paper, thesis or report), but then accidentally ruined it. How would you retrieve the earlier brilliant version? Is it even possible?

- "In the past, I mostly worked with doc documents (word) and saved every day a new version when I was the only person working on the document. This was not very practical and I hope to learn an alternative during this course"

#### (...) Consider a situation where you are working with five co-authors on a paper. How do you handle the changes and comments they make to the document

- "I know that you can accept changes and comments in word, but I always find it confusing and complex to keep the overview. I don't know what happens to the history of modifications."

## The issue of computational reproducibility in science

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
*"... when the **same analysis** steps performed on the **same dataset** consistently produce the **same answer**."* ^[@turingway2022, see ["Guide on Reproducible Research"](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions)]

![by [Scriberia]({{< var links.scriberia >}}) for @turingway2022 ([Link](https://zenodo.org/record/3678226/), [CC BY

:::
::::
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
### The problem
:::
::: {.incremental}
- about **more than half** of research is **not reproducible** [^1]
  - research data, code, software & materials are **often not available** "upon *reasonable* [sic] request"
  - if resources are shared, they are **often incomplete**
- 90% of researchers: "reproducibility crisis" (*N* = 1576) ^[see @baker2016, *Nature*]

:::
::: {.fragment}
### Why?
:::
::: {.incremental}
- computational reproducibility is hard
- researchers lack training 
- incentives are not (yet) aligned ^[see e.g., @poldrack2019]
- "natural selection of bad science" ^[see @smaldino2016]
:::

"*... accumulated evidence indicates [...] **substantial room for improvement** with regard to research practices to maximize the efficiency of the research community's use of the public's financial investment.*" [@munafÃ²2017]
:::
::: {.fragment}
We need a **professional toolkit** for digital research!
:::

[^1]: for example, in Psychology: @crÃ¼well2023; @hardwicke2021; @obels2020; @wicherts2006


::: {.notes}
- also called "analytical reproducibility"
- in contrast: "Replication" = same analysis on different data
- computational reproducibility should be a *minimum* requirement
- 90% of respondents to a survey in Nature agreed that there is a "reproducibility crisis"
- non-scientist friends react very surprised at the lack of professionalization in science
- we are currently violating the public's trust = deep ethical problem
- natural selection: as a researcher, what's good for your career is not necessarily good for science (how to get funding, how to get published, how to get cited)
- journals are interested in selling us back our data, not improving the quality of science

## What is version control?

::: {.fragment}
*"Version control is a systematic approach to record changes made in a [...] set of files, over time. This allows you and your collaborators to track the history, see what changed, and recall specific versions later [...]"* ([Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/vcs.html))
:::

::::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
{{< fa laptop-code >}} keep track of changes in a directory (a "repository")

{{< fa code-commit >}} take snapshots ("commits") of your repo at any time

{{< fa timeline >}} know the history: what was changed when by whom

{{< fa code-compare >}} compare commits and go back to any previous state

{{< fa code-pull-request >}} work on parallel "branches" & flexibly "merge" them
