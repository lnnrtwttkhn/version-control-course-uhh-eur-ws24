::: {.notes}
- we heard a lot about artificial intelligence
- what does "intelligence" even mean?
- as psychologists & cognitive neuroscientists we are interested in understanding human "natural" or biological intelligence
- our group is interested in the convergence between neuroscience and artificial intelligence research ("Neuro AI")
- e.g., "why are humans so fast in learning a wide range of tasks in complex environments"
- we use cognitive and psychological approaches, neural measurement using fMRI and EEG and integrate and compare them with computational approaches from reinforcement learning and artificial neural networks

## What will the average seminar session look like?

::: {.fragment}
{{< fa clock >}} The course will consist of up to 13 sessions (90 minutes each)
:::

::: {.fragment}
1. {{< fa book-open >}} **Content Review (up to 30 minutes):**
<br> Course participants engage with [the online materials]({{< var links.book >}}) (aka. our "Version Control Book"), supplemented by short presentations by the instructors.
Some course preparation may occur outside of the class.
:::

::: {.fragment}
2. {{< fa comments >}} **Interactive Discussions & Quizzes (up to 15 minutes):**
<br>Course participants collectively address any inquiries related to the session's content and online materials.
Instructor-led quiz questions may also be interspersed throughout.
:::

::: {.fragment}
3. {{< fa laptop-code >}} **Exercises & Implementation (up to 60 minutes):**
<br>Course participants actively delve into hands-on exercises and assignments.
:::

::: {.fragment}
### Logistics

- {{< fa laptop >}} You need a laptop.
Talk to us if you don't have a laptop.

:::

::: {.fragment}
Note, that course participants are **sometimes required to work on course materials outside of class time**.

Not all course contents will be covered during class time.

```{=html}
<iframe width="100%" height="74%" src="{{< var project.site >}}" title="Course Website"></iframe>
```

::: {.notes}
- Course website is the main entry point for students before, during and after the course
- Contents: Overview, course details, schedule, information about the team, additional resources and course mechanics
- Practical advantage: Update course information independently from university websites that are out of your control

## Exercises, quizzes & surveys

::: {.fragment}
- We use online surveys to ask you questions and implement exercises or quizzes
- Implemented in the [formr]({{< var links.formr >}}) survey framework (open-source, hosted in Germany)
:::

::: {.fragment}
#### Anonymity & data usage

- all raw data are kept **anonymous** and will only be **used for research and educational purposes**
- if responses are shared as part of the course, they will be aggregated to ensure anonymity is maintained
- if you want your data to be deleted *after the course*, send an email with your personal codeword to [{{< var project.email-secretary >}}]({{< var project.mailto-secretary >}}) (Christine Manor).
Our secretary forwards your codeword to us (without your name).
:::

## Your role: Questions and communication

::: {.fragment}
#### **Questions & discussions *during* class time**
- Ask questions!
There are no stupid questions!
- Participate in the discussions
- We can use Zoom Breakout Rooms to address individual questions
:::

    - We take screenshots of the Zoom participants list
    - University of Hamburg: You may need to sign the attendance list (at the end of the semester; TBA)
1. Requirement 2: **Provide a personal codeword**.
At the end of the semester, send an email with your personal codeword to [{{< var project.email-secretary >}}]({{< var project.mailto-secretary >}}) (Christine Manor).
We will send our secretary a list of personal codewords and she will return a list of names.
1. Requirement 3: At the end of the semester, **send a link to your completed exercises**.

## The issue of computational reproducibility in science

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
*"... when the **same analysis** steps performed on the **same dataset** consistently produce the **same answer**."* ^[@turingway2022, see ["Guide on Reproducible Research"](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions)]

![by [Scriberia]({{< var links.scriberia >}}) for @turingway2022 ([Link](https://zenodo.org/record/3678226/), [CC BY

:::
::::
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
### The problem
:::
::: {.incremental}
- about **more than half** of research is **not reproducible** [^1]
  - research data, code, software & materials are **often not available** "upon *reasonable* [sic] request"
  - if resources are shared, they are **often incomplete**
- 90% of researchers: "reproducibility crisis" (*N* = 1576) ^[see @baker2016, *Nature*]

:::
::: {.fragment}
### Why?
:::
::: {.incremental}
- computational reproducibility is hard
- researchers lack training 
- incentives are not (yet) aligned ^[see e.g., @poldrack2019]
- "natural selection of bad science" ^[see @smaldino2016]
:::

"*... accumulated evidence indicates [...] **substantial room for improvement** with regard to research practices to maximize the efficiency of the research community's use of the public's financial investment.*" [@munaf√≤2017]
:::
::: {.fragment}
We need a **professional toolkit** for digital research!
:::

[^1]: for example, in Psychology: @cr√ºwell2023; @hardwicke2021; @obels2020; @wicherts2006


::: {.notes}
- also called "analytical reproducibility"
- in contrast: "Replication" = same analysis on different data
- computational reproducibility should be a *minimum* requirement
- 90% of respondents to a survey in Nature agreed that there is a "reproducibility crisis"
- non-scientist friends react very surprised at the lack of professionalization in science
- we are currently violating the public's trust = deep ethical problem
- natural selection: as a researcher, what's good for your career is not necessarily good for science (how to get funding, how to get published, how to get cited)
- journals are interested in selling us back our data, not improving the quality of science

## What is version control?

::: {.fragment}
*"Version control is a systematic approach to record changes made in a [...] set of files, over time. This allows you and your collaborators to track the history, see what changed, and recall specific versions later [...]"* ([Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/vcs.html))
:::

::::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
{{< fa laptop-code >}} keep track of changes in a directory (a "repository")

{{< fa code-commit >}} take snapshots ("commits") of your repo at any time

{{< fa timeline >}} know the history: what was changed when by whom

{{< fa code-compare >}} compare commits and go back to any previous state

{{< fa code-pull-request >}} work on parallel "branches" & flexibly "merge" them

## What is Git?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.fragment}
![[git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)](../images/git-logo-full.svg){fig-align="center" width=50%}

- most popular version control system
- free, [open-source](https://github.com/git) command-line tool
- graphical user interfaces exist, e.g., [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
- standard tool for most (all?) software developers
- 100 million [GitHub](https://github.com/) users ^[(Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub))]

- {{< fa code-fork >}} Create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of someone else's repository and extend their teaching materials
- {{< fa key >}} Manage access to your teaching materials with detailed [permissions and roles](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html)

**Note**

- {{< fa brands github >}} The dominance of GitHub (a for-profit company owned by Microsoft) is not uncontested (see [#GiveUpGitHub](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/))
- {{< fa boxes-packing >}} A project on GitHub is not a FAIR archiving of scholarly outputs (see previous and following slides)
:::

::: {.notes}
- GitHub Copilot is a for-profit AI product trained with projects that were hosted on GitHub, including many that have licenses that require proper author attribution etc.
- GitHub has a for-profit software services contract with the USA Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
- Archiving on GitHub is not enough
