Each course session follows a roughly structured format as outlined below:\n\n Content Review (up to 30 minutes):  Course participants engage with the online materials, supplemented by concise presentations by the instructors. Some course preparation may occur outside of the class.\n Interactive Discussions & Quizzes (up to 15 minutes): Course participants collectively address any inquiries related to the session’s content and online materials. Instructor-led quiz questions may also be interspersed throughout.\n Exercises & Implementation (up to 60 minutes): Course participants actively delve into hands-on exercises and assignments.\n\nNote, that course participants are sometimes required to work on course materials outside of class time. Not all course contents will be covered during class time."

    "text": "Email\nDear course participants,\nThank you for your participation in the course “Track, organize and share your work: An introduction to Git for psychological research”. It was a pleasure for us teaching this course and we hope that you learned something useful. Following up on our last session yesterday, we have a few important announcements and tasks for you to complete:\nFirst, please make sure to complete the course evaluation using the following link:\nhttps://evasys-online.uni-hamburg.de/evasys/online.php?pswd=NWSWC\nYour feedback is very valuable to us and will help us to improve the course even further. Also, course evaluations are relevant for Lennart’s academic career, so you would do him a great favor. Thank you!\nSecond, please remember to complete all tasks relevant for passing the course, mainly completing the quizzes and all recipes repository tasks:\nRegarding the quizzes: Almost everyone has completed all the necessary quizzes. Attached to this email is a list of missing quizzes associated with each personal codeword. Note, that only the quizzes in bold text need to be completed to pass. If anything seems incorrect, please let us know immediately. Additionally, please remember to send our secretary (Christine Manor) an email with your personal codeword at sekretariat-luv.psych@uni-hamburg.de.\nRegarding the exercises: Most of you have also completed all implementation tasks in your own repository. Here is the list of required tasks again with instructions on how you can check if you have completed them or not:\n\nYou have a public recipes repository on GitHub.\nYou added a text file (e.g., .qmd or .txt) with at least one recipe to the repository.\nYou created a pull request in a partner’s repository (e.g., adding a new recipe).\nYou merged the pull request of a partner in your recipes repository.\nYou created a pull request in Lennart’s recipes repository, you implemented all additional requests and your pull request was merged by Lennart.\nYou implemented the changes suggested by Konrad in your recipes repository and closed the issue.\nYou created a release of your recipes repository on GitHub.\n\nWe will review your repositories in a week, and you will receive an email then if you have not already completed everything. Importantly, as mentioned during the seminar: Please don’t worry too much about the pass/fail requirements. We will make sure that everyone has had enough time and help to complete all these tasks.\nThird, for everyone who missed more than two sessions: You will receive a separate email with an additional task shortly that we ask you to complete to make up for any additional missed sessions. Completing this assignment is an extra task for you in order to pass the course requirements. We will continuously mark everyone as passed on Stine who completed all tasks.\nFinally, we really hope that you found the course useful and that you will have future opportunities to apply your new skills in a project. Using Git in a “real-world project” will bring new challenges but we promise that it will be immensely beneficial in the long run and an invaluable chance to further practice your Git skills. The Version Control Book and course website will stay online for the foreseeable future and we will continue developing these materials so you can always go back to these materials for later reference. Also, and we really mean this, always feel free to reach out to us if you have any further questions or problems using Git.\nThank you again for your participation in the course and enjoy the summer!\nBest wishes,\nLennart Wittkuhn (Instructor) & Konrad Pagenstedt (Teaching Assistant)"

Detailed instructions can be found in the slides for session 9 (Task 1) and session 10. We leave it up to you whether you add each other as collaborators to your repositories or use a fork. Please don’t forget to open an issue in your partner’s repository first and, ideally, close the issue by referencing it in your pull request or commit. The assignment is completed once your PR is merged.\nPlease complete this extra assignment together with the other requirements by the end of July.\nIf you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to contact us directly via email.\nBest wishes,\nLennart Wittkuhn (Instructor) & Konrad Pagenstedt (Teaching Assistant)"

We are excited that you have signed up for this course and can’t wait to delve into the world of version control with you. Our first session takes place next Monday, April 08, 2024, from 12:15 to 13:45 at Von-Melle-Park 5, Room 3016.\nIn order to tailor the course to your prior experience and needs, we have prepared a short survey with a few questions. Please complete the survey before our first session, ideally by Sunday evening (April 07, 2024). This will give us enough time to review your responses before our first session on Monday.\nThe survey can be accessed here: https://version-control-intro.formr.org\nA few technical remarks about the survey: The survey will ask you for two codewords: a personal codeword and a course codeword.\nThe personal codeword is used to associate your responses with a unique identifier. This will allow us to identify and relate your responses across surveys while ensuring anonymity. By providing a personal codeword, you will allow us to draw more detailed insights from your responses that will help us improve the course for you. The survey will contain an explanation of how to generate your personal codeword.\nThe course codeword is used to tag your responses as coming from a course participant at University of Hamburg. We might also use the survey to collect responses from participants in other course settings. The course codeword allows us to distinguish responses from different course settings.\nThe course codeword is: -------- (course password will be announced during the course).\nApart from answering the survey, you don’t need to prepare anything else for our first session on Monday.\nFurther information about the course can be found on our course website: https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-course-uhh-ss24\nIf you have any questions, feel free to contact us directly via email.\nWe are looking forward to seeing you for the first session on Monday!\nBest wishes,\nLennart Wittkuhn (Instructor) & Konrad Pagenstedt (Teaching Assistant)"

While this is not mandatory, please try to remove any unnecessary files or clutter, like empty .txt files from your repository. You can delete files directly on GitHub by clicking on the three dots next to the directory or file and selecting “Delete file,” then commit the changes. This effectively runs git add and git commit on GitHub.\n\nIf you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to contact us via email.\nWe look forward to seeing you next Monday!\nBest wishes,\nLennart Wittkuhn (Instructor) & Konrad Pagenstedt (Teaching Assistant)"

    "text": "Description\n\nContent\nIn today’s digital age, the majority of scientific insights in psychological research are gained from the analysis of data using programming code. Although data and code are integral parts of their work, scientists often handle digital objects on their computers in a somewhat chaotic, unreliable, and irreproducible manner. It’s not uncommon to hear researchers wondering, “Which version of my data and code did I use to get this result?” or “I found a bug in my code. Since when was it there?” and “This code used to work! What did I change?”. This not only affects the reproducibility and trustworthiness of science but also frequently leads to frustration, a waste of time, and, at worst, the loss of painstakingly accumulated work. The good news is that scientists can learn about practices and tools from other disciplines, particularly software engineering, that have significantly professionalized collaborative work on digital objects like programming code. At the core of this toolkit is the free and open-source software Git, a so-called version control system that allows tracking and organizing the evolution of digital objects on computers and sharing them via platforms like GitHub. In this hands-on course with practical exercises, participants will learn how to track, organize and share their work using Git.\n\n\nGoals\nThe primary aim of this course is to empower students with the skills to efficiently organize projects on their computers using Git and GitHub. Participants will actively engage in hands-on experiences with these tools, exploring both the command-line and Graphical User Interfaces. Proficiency in Git and GitHub not only enhances students’ effectiveness in conducting research projects by ensuring organized and reproducible workflows but also elevates their employability. The technical skills acquired in this course are increasingly sought after in various work settings, providing students with a competitive edge in today’s dynamic job market.\n\n\nMechanics\nGuided by the seminar instructor, participants will receive input while working through a dedicated Git Handbook (https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/) that is tuned to the structure of the course and needs of the students, as well as engaging in practical hands-on exercises with Git and GitHub."
