## What will the average seminar session look like?

The course will consist of a maximum of 14 sessions, each lasting 90 minutes (for more details, please refer to the [schedule](schedule.qmd)).
Each course session follows a roughly structured format as outlined below:

1. {{< fa book-open >}} **Content Review (up to 30 minutes):**
<br> Course participants engage with [the online materials]({{< var links.book >}}), supplemented by concise presentations by the instructors.
Some course preparation may occur outside of the class.
   
2. {{< fa comments >}} **Interactive Discussions & Quizzes (up to 15 minutes):**
<br>Course participants collectively address any inquiries related to the session's content and online materials.
Instructor-led quiz questions may also be interspersed throughout.

3. {{< fa laptop-code >}} **Exercises & Implementation (up to 60 minutes):**
<br>Course participants actively work on hands-on exercises and assignments.

Note, that course participants are **sometimes required to work on course materials outside of class time**.
Not **all** course contents will be covered during class time.

## Course Materials

### Textbook: Version Control Book

Course participants will be asked to study specific chapters in the ["Version Control Book"]({{< var links.book >}}).
The Version Control Book aims to summarize all the relevant course contents for the students, effectively serving as a textbook for the course.
In addition, we will provide references to multiple other learning resources, allowing students to pick from those learning resources that they feel supports their learning process best.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites to take part in this course.
Programming experience (any language) can be beneficial but is not required to follow the course contents.

## Active Learning

Active learning in this class involves engaging in **hands-on coding activities during class time**.
Research on active learning indicates that this approach promotes a greater understanding and retention of the material compared to passive teaching methods [see e.g., @deslauriers2019].

## Assignments

Course participants will work on assignments (individually or in [pairs](#pair-programming)) during class.

## Pair Programming

Our course assignments are inspired by the concept of "pair programming".
For the hands-on exercises, we actively encourage or even require course participants to work in pairs or small groups.

> Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation.
One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator [@williams2001], reviews each line of code as it is typed in.
The two programmers switch roles frequently.
